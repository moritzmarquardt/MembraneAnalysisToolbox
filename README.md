# Membrane Analysis Toolbox

The MembraneAnalysisToolbox is a python package than can be installed in a python environment via pip.

This toolbox contains methods for analysing molecular dynamics simulation data of Membranes.
It has been developed in the group of Kristyna Pluhackova at the University of Stuttgart for analysing metal organic frameworks and their properties. This Toolbox also uses work by Gotthold Fl√§schner.

## Main Components:
- TransitionPathAnalysis class with the following key features:
    - Analyse passages through membrane and their **passage time distribution**
    - Calculate the **diffusion coefficient** for a solvent
- EffectivePoreSizeAnalysis class with the following key features:
    - Analyse the **effective pore radius** of a membrane pore
    - Analyse the density of molecules in the pore using kernels for a **density heatmap**


## Installation:
MembraneAnalysisToolbox is developed using python 3.12 and installing it requires a minimum of python 3.12.

1) Download or clone this repository
2) Run `pip install [path to package]` in your python environment

## Usage
- In `usage/` you can find a collection of ready-to-run python scripts for different analyses and a how to use in `usage/README.md`.

- Look at `examples/` to see how the classes are imported and used if you want to write your own code.

- Check out the `best_practice.pdf` for some best practices on using this package.
